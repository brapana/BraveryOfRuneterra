      <h2>Why would anyone make this?</h2>
      <p>While there are several "bravery"-type websites in existence for League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics (my other favorite Riot Games), I felt like there was a disappointing lack of such a website for Legends of Runeterra.
        With a sizeable amount of downtime due to quarantine, creating Bravery of Runeterra was not only a great opportunity to add another project to my Software Engineering resume, but to create something fun for
        both myself and the Legends of Runeterra community.
        </p>

      <h2>I don't own that many cards!</h2>
      <p>While I realize that needing to own cards may introduce a bar of entry for using Bravery of Runeterra, I hope that players with sizeable card collections can still find joy in taking some randomized decks for a spin.
      That said, I would love to hear your suggestions on how to lower this bar and I am looking at future options such as narrowing card selection to cards owned by the player when such API endpoints are made available.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Who would do this?</h2>
      <p>I am a Software Engineering student at the University of California, Irvine who loves programming and Legends of Runeterra.
        I am currently seeking Summer 2021 internships as well as full-time opportunities in the US (please contact me via the methods below if you have any opportunities!).
        I have been playing Legends of Runeterra since the beta, and I absolutely love what Riot Games has done with the digital card game formula.
        I am also a big fan of Riot's other games League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics, the former which I have been playing since 2013. </p>

      <br>
      <h2>Questions, Suggestions, etc.</h2>
      <p>Please feel free to contact me using any of the methods below regarding Bravery of Runeterra.
        I am looking forward to hearing your questions, suggestions, feedback, or anything else you want to talk about.
        I'm mostly self-taught in web development so if I've made a mistake or there's a better design decision I could make I would love to know!</p>
